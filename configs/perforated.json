# This is a config file for FEM_membrane test runs
# Setup description:
# Rectangular membrane 6x24 cm with perforation. 
# Bottom side is fixed, other free
# Strike with force 5*10^10 Newton/m^3 in downward direction
# Applied to small circle with radius  5 mm and center in the middle of top side
# for a short period of time 0.01 seconds
# PS: you can add/delete comments as long as they are on a separate line starting with '#'
# PPS the physical meaning of this case is questionable
