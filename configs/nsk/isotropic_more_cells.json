# This is a config file for FEM_membrane test runs
# Setup description:
# Square membrane with free border. Material is isotropic. 
# Strike with fixed speed 500 m/s in center point
# Direction of strike is normal to the surface
# Only difference from isotropic.json is that there are more cells in grid
# PS: you can add/delete comments as long as they are on a separate line starting with '#'
